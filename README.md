# ML
## So, i'm going to implement machine learning algorithms in C here.


Most of the example programs will have an accompanying python script that calls the program and then visualizes its output with matplotlib or similar.

Things done so far:
  - A crude linear algebra library
  - A PCA implementation and example program
